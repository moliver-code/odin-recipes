        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 onion, roughly chopped

            </li>
            <li>
                2 carrots, roughly chopped

            </li>
            <li>
                1 free range chicken, about 1.5kg/3lb 5oz

            </li>
            <li>
                1 lemon, halved

            </li>
            <li>
                small bunch thyme (optional)

            </li>
            <li>
                25g butter, softened

            </li>
            <h3>For the gravy</h3>
            <li>
                1 tbsp plain flour

            </li>
            <li>
                250ml chicken stock (a cube is fine)

            </li>
          
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>
            Steps
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Have a shelf ready in the middle of the oven without any shelves above it.


            </li>
            <li>
                Scatter 1 roughly chopped onion and 2 roughly chopped carrots over the base of a roasting tin that fits the whole 1 ½ kg chicken, but doesn’t swamp it.


            </li>
            <li>
                Season the cavity of the chicken liberally with salt and pepper, then stuff with 2 lemon halves and a small bunch of thyme, if using.


            </li>
            <li>
                Sit the chicken on the vegetables, smother the breast and legs all over with 25g softened butter, then season the outside with salt and pepper.


            </li>
            <li>
                Place in the oven and leave, undisturbed, for 1 hr 20 mins – this will give you a perfectly roasted chicken. To check, pierce the thigh with a skewer and the juices should run clear.


            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully remove the tin from the oven and, using a pair of tongs, lift the chicken to a dish or board to rest for 15-20 mins. As you lift the dish, let any juices from the chicken pour out of the cavity into the roasting tin.


            </li>
            <li>
                While the chicken is resting, make the gravy. Place the roasting tin over a low flame, then stir in 1 tbsp flour and sizzle until you have a light brown, sandy paste.


            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually pour in 250ml chicken stock, stirring all the time, until you have a thickened sauce.

 
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer for 2 mins, using a wooden spoon to stir, scraping any sticky bits from the tin.


            </li>
            <li>
                Strain the gravy into a small saucepan, then simmer and season to taste. When you carve the bird, add any extra juices to the gravy.


            </li>
